PDB autofill classifies the reason behind missing electron densities in crystallographic experimental data from the Protein Data Bank, predicts the structure of the missing densities, and predicts whether a new X-ray crystallography experiment will result in missing residues.

## Features

* Classify the reason for missing residues in PDB files according to features as described below
* Data processing of PDB files. Features available to extract in this module include: protein sequences to DataFrame, resolution of experiment, maximum anisotropic B factor in protein, and number of hydrophobic/nonpolar/electrically charged/special case residues
* Prediction of missing residue coordinates.
* A sample dataset is available for use in this package for users that are new to PDB files
* See `functional_spec.py` and `component_spec.py` in the doc folder for more information on function and components. 


## Example
```
import getdata
import PDB_Data_Processing

# downloads sample dataset into your local machine
getdata.get_samples()

# names of PDB files to explore
protein_list = ['1a0j', '1a3b', '1a7v', '1a09', '1a46', '1a52', '1a55', '1a95', '1ad4', '1adw']

# extract features of interest to dataframe
pdb.extracted_features('small_sample/', protein_list)

```
